* $\lambda_{\mathtt{IFC}}^\star$, A Gradual Security-Typed Programming Language

$\lambda_{\mathtt{IFC}}^\star$ is an experimental gradual security-typed
programming language. $\lambda_{\mathtt{IFC}}^\star$ is /gradual/, in that it
provides the programmer with the freedom of choice between runtime versus
compile-time enforcement. $\lambda_{\mathtt{IFC}}^\star$ is /secure/, because it
enforces information-flow security and satisfies noninterference.
