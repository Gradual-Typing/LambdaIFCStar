# About

$\lambda_{\mathtt{SEC}}^\star$ is an experimental gradual security-typed programming language.
It provides programmers with the freedom of choice between runtime versus compile-time
information-flow (IFC) enforcement.
The Agda development of $\lambda_{\mathtt{SEC}}^\star$ comes with machine-checked proofs of
various meta-theoretical results.

# Building and Testing

We compile $\lambda_{\mathtt{SEC}}^\star$ into an intermediate representation ("cast calculus"),
namely, $\lambda_{\mathtt{SEC}}^\Rightarrow$. We define an operational semantics for
$\lambda_{\mathtt{SEC}}^\star$ that includes blame tracking.

You can check proofs and explore examples by following the steps:

## Prerequisites

### Software dependencies for checking proofs:

- [Agda](https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda) `2.6.3`
- [Standard library](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib) `v1.7.2 (b2e6385)`
- [Abstract binding trees](https://github.com/jsiek/abstract-binding-trees/)
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

### Additional dependencies for running demo:

- GHC with working [MAlonzo](https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/Docs/MAlonzo)

### Additional dependencies for generating simulation diagrams:

- XeLaTeX and `latexmk`
- [GraphViz](https://graphviz.org/) and specifically, `dot`
- [Dot2TeX](https://dot2tex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/), for running plotting scripts

## Building

+ To build everything, simply run `make` at the top level of this repository.
    - This will build the proofs, the runnable demo, and a simulation explorer.

+ To check the proofs only, run `make proofs`.
  The type-checker of Agda makes sure everything is correct.

+ **[Advanced]** To build the simulator only, run `make sim`.

## Running Demo

To get a taste of $\lambda_{\mathtt{SEC}}^\star$ running in action, 
build everything first and then run `bin/RunDemo`.

# File Structure

+ `src/Proofs.agda`: sources the proofs of several important
  meta-theoretical results, most noticeably, type safety and noninterference.
  This file depends upon modules in the following sub-directories:
  - `src/Surface/`: contains syntax and type system of
    $\lambda_{\mathtt{SEC}}^\star$. This is the "surface language",
    i.e., the language exposed to the programmers.
  - `src/Memory/`: contains our heap model. The heap has a public, low-security
    region and a secretive, high-security region.
  - `src/CC/`: the formal specification of $\lambda_{\mathtt{SEC}}^\Rightarrow$:
    its syntax, its type system, and its operational semantics (both small-step
    and big-step).
      * `src/CC/Compile.agda`: defines type-preserving compilation
        from $\lambda_{\mathtt{SEC}}^\star$ to $\lambda_{\mathtt{SEC}}^\Rightarrow$.

+ `src/Examples.agda`: contains examples programs. It sources the
  following modules:
  - `src/ExamplePrograms/Example1.agda`: shows that
    $\lambda_{\mathtt{SEC}}^\star$ indeed facilitates both compile-time
    (static) and runtime (dynamic) information-flow control.
    If a $\lambda_{\mathtt{SEC}}^\star$ program is fully statically-typed,
    our type system alone guarantees security. Transition between
    static and dynamic is controlled by the precision of type annotations
    given by the programmer.
  - `src/ExamplePrograms/Example2.agda`: establishes the
    intuition that even if the programmer opts for runtime enforcement,
    $\lambda_{\mathtt{SEC}}^\star$ still guards against any possible
    information leakage.
  - `src/ExamplePrograms/Example3.agda`: shows that moving
    type annotations to be less precise (or more dynamic) does not change
    the runtime behaviors of a program.

+ `src/RunDemo.agda`: interprets the $\lambda_{\mathtt{SEC}}^\Rightarrow$
  terms generated by the above example programs. It pretty-prints
  reduction steps to console output.
